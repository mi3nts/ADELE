# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to take in biometrics and EEG ratings, automatically split them apart into distinct events, correlate these events to what stimuli were occurring at the time using unsupervised classification, and display these results in a clear, easy to parse fashion.

ADELE is more advanced than other solutions in that it handles the data analysis almost entirely automatically. It searches the data for correlations between different EEG bands and biometrics and splits them off together with their timestamps and stimuli, instead of manually requiring humans to track the different events and correlate them with the readings.
